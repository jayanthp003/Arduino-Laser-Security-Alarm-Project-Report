# Arduino-Laser-Security-Alarm-Project-Report
The Arduino Laser Security Alarm project aims to create a simple yet effective security system
using an Arduino board, a laser module, and a light-dependent resistor (LDR). The system is
designed to detect any interruption in the laser beam and trigger an alarm to alert the user.
