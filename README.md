# Arduino-Laser-Security-Alarm-Project-Report
The Arduino Laser Security Alarm project aims to create a simple yet effective security system
using an Arduino board, a laser module, and a light-dependent resistor (LDR). The system is
designed to detect any interruption in the laser beam and trigger an alarm to alert the user.

This project focuses on developing a **laser-based security alarm system** using an **Arduino microcontroller**. The system consists of a **laser module** that continuously emits a beam towards an **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) or a photodiode**. When an object obstructs the laser beam, the Arduino detects the change in light intensity and triggers an **alarm system** (buzzer, LED, or notification alert). This setup is useful for **intruder detection, door security, and perimeter protection**.  

The project integrates **low-cost components** and can be further enhanced with **wireless alerts using IoT, GSM, or Bluetooth modules**. It demonstrates a simple yet effective security mechanism suitable for homes, offices, and restricted areas.
